# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - asset/background/
     - asset/logo/
     - asset/text-image/
     - asset/font/Poppins/
     - asset/font/Lora/
     - asset/font/ZapfHumanist/
     - asset/icon/
     - asset/icon/inputType/
     - asset/icon/otherIcon/
     - asset/gif/
     - asset/json/
     - asset/icon/appbaricon/
     - asset/icon/bottomIcon/
     - asset/icon/drawericon/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Poppins
       fonts:
         - asset: asset/font/Poppins/Poppins-Black.ttf
         - asset: asset/font/Poppins/Poppins-BlackItalic.ttf
         - asset: asset/font/Poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
         - asset: asset/font/Poppins/Poppins-BoldItalic.ttf
         - asset: asset/font/Poppins/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
         - asset: asset/font/Poppins/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
